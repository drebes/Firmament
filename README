FIRMAMENT is a packet processor aimed at communication fault injection
which uses the netfilter framework of the Linux kernel.

The firm_vm kernel module interprets faultlet applications created
with the firm_asm assembler, for each packet that crosses any of
the configured flows (IPv4 and IPv6 in and out).

Faultlets can modify packet contents, delay, duplicate or drop
packets, or manipulate packets in other advanced ways (specified
by the user).

To compile FIRMAMENT, just type make. You may have to edit the KSRC
variable in module/Makefile to point to your current kernel build
directory.

The asm directory contains the firm_asm assembler and msa_mrif
disassembler.

The module directory contains the firm_vm kernel module.

The faultlets directory contains some example faultlets.

The doc directory contains documentation on creating your own
faultlets, and instructions about installing and operating, and
extending the tool.
